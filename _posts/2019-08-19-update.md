### hello, world!

i'm not one to keep a public log. i prefer more ephemeral logs: self-destructing tweets, journals haphazardly thrown into fires, post it notes left behind at at random cafes. i'm kind of in a weird, melancholic place right now. despite consistent exercise, sleep, eating, and socializing, i haven't been feeling particularly great lately (to put it lightly) -- especially my work and overall career trajectory. there was a point in time where i genuinely enjoyed creating toy projects and honing in my computer science skills in my spare time and i've lost touch with that.

while i combat what feels like a burnout of sorts, i've decided to copy [elias](https://ageof.info/logs/) and keep a little [changelog](/changelog). my intention is to use the changelog as a tool alongside daily journaling and other means of tracking to show myself things genuinely are better than i perceive them to be in the moment.
