<p>I didn’t get a chance to code all that much Friday. My morning was spent helping my product owner debug/give a technical perspective on an issue that was brought up in our support channel. Beyond that, I worked on a small amount of technical debt and went to a brainstorming meeting for a new feature we need to add soon.</p>

<p>I had friends in town this weekend! We spent our time eating good food, walking around midtown and enjoying the good weather, and catching up after a long summer.</p>

<p>Saturday evening I went on a very quick 1.5mi run around the neighborhood. Just enough say I did something. Tomorrow I hope to avoid any thunderstorms and get a longer run in.</p>

<p>I haven’t read <em>Feeling Good</em> for a few days, but I did get to the part where Burns discussed documenting cognitive distortions, categorizing them, and reframing them. I know there’s a number of apps that approach this idea, but the latest (and nicest…?) one I know of is <a href="https://github.com/Flaque/quirk">Quirk</a>. It’s under the GPL license so I’m thiking about building and loading it onto my phone…just…because… I really don’t have a good reason, it just sounded like a good idea at the time lol.</p>
