<p>truthfully, iâ€™ve been really struggling all month. this week i had a random and horribly inconvenient bout of food poisoning (i think, maybe, idk stomach flu and food poisoning have super similar symptoms according to google) and i havenâ€™t eaten a full dayâ€™s worth of calories since monday. work-wise, iâ€™ve been a mess (lol). i donâ€™t know why i have such an abject lack of confidence some weeks, but i do and it has been unrelenting the last few weeks. late last week, i picked up a â€œspikeâ€ (a.k.a â€˜do some researchâ€™ in agile world) centered around a new feature we wanted to build that is intended to be pretty client-specific (for now), but impacts a pretty integral part of the product iâ€™m working on <em>and i donâ€™t want to fuck up!!</em> weâ€™ve had instances where weâ€™ve just thrown work into our models and schema without really breaking it down as a group, thought it was fine at review time, and then have to take twice as long to refactor it to make it better. i genuinely cherish the fact weâ€™re able to iterate like this without consequence (kinda), but it really takes away from the collaborative environment i genuinely want. along with that, last week i rushed in a change so a big client of ours could QA this week and i totally failed to do a simple null/undefined check in my change and it prevented them from QAing tuesday morning. i got it fixed super quickly (before succumbing to my food poisoning), but i always struggle with not beating myself up for small mistakes like that. probably tmi, but after todayâ€™s refinement i just ran off to the bathroom to cry because i have been so overwhelmed and uncertain and simply not confident in myself lately. iâ€™m hoping to eat a real meal this evening and maybe work out (or at least walk the dog). maybe iâ€™ll turn on paper mario or something to get my mind off of work and general health woes.</p>
