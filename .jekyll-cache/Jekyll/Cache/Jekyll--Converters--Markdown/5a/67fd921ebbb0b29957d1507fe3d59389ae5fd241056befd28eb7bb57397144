<p>i really ought to make a habit of keeping up with these logs from friday-sunday. i very rarely pick up a laptop over the weekend, though. despite only being sick tuesday, i didnâ€™t feel fully cognizant until friday. saturday was full of cleaning i had put off, lifting, and good honey shrimp from the closest chinese restaurant. sunday started later than i wanted, but i managed to do a 14 mile bike ride from westport to the river and back to westport. i regret not bringing a water bladder because my neon yellow water bottle was already empty by the time i hit 9 miles. i didnâ€™t even plan on going that far, i was just having a good time. i ended my sunday playing duck game with elias on my switch. while he may disagree, iâ€™m way better at the game than he is. tomorrow is eliasâ€™ birthday and i am completely unprepared present-wise. weâ€™re still going to celebrate by going to a restaurant he likes, i think.</p>
