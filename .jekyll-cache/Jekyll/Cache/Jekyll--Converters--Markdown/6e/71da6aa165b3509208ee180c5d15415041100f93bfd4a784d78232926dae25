<p>i didnâ€™t mean to go so long without pushing a log. i havenâ€™t been having a particularly bad week, iâ€™ve just forgotten!!</p>

<p>work-wise, we have about a month to finish the remaining QA items before ${BIG_CLIENT} launches their site. it honestly has me super stressed out. some of the bugs theyâ€™re finding are quite weird.</p>

<p>exerise-wise, i havenâ€™t been doing any super tough workouts. pius has gone on a few runs with me, iâ€™ve learned to enjoy lifing on my own, and have reacquainted myself with the ~dread~treadmill. tonight iâ€™ll probably do a quick treadmill hill run. one thing iâ€™d like to incorporate is rock climbing again, as well as more ab workouts.</p>

<p>non-work-wise, i picked up rust book again and am giving it a real run-through. iâ€™m looking forward to the project at the end and figuring out new projects to pursue.</p>
