<p>iâ€™m not one to keep a public log. i prefer more ephemeral logs: self-destructing tweets, journals haphazardly thrown into fires, post it notes left behind at at random cafes. iâ€™m kind of in a weird, melancholic place right now. despite consistent exercise, sleep, eating, and socializing, i havenâ€™t been feeling particularly great lately (to put it lightly) â€“ especially my work and overall career trajectory. there was a point in time where i genuinely enjoyed creating toy projects and honing in my computer science skills in my spare time and iâ€™ve lost touch with that.</p>

<p>while i combat what feels like a burnout of sorts, iâ€™ve decided to copy <a href="https://ageof.info/logs/">elias</a> and keep a little <a href="/changelog">changelog</a>. my intention is to use the changelog as a tool alongside daily journaling and other means of tracking to show myself things genuinely are better than i perceive them to be in the moment.</p>
