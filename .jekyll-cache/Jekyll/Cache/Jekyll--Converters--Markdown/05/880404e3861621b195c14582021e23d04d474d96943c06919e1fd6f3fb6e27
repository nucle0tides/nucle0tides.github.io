<p>today i did a lot more research on the issues weâ€™re having with <a href="https://github.com/smooth-code/loadable-components">loadable-components</a>. i think itâ€™s centered around how weâ€™re reading the stats file. regardless, i may be able to at least set up the recommended <code class="highlighter-rouge">ErrorBoundary</code> called out in their documentation. iâ€™m not sure how iâ€™ll actually fix the issue. weâ€™ll see!</p>

<p>after papers we love, iâ€™m hoping to get over to the gym to lift. iâ€™ve gone with elias twice now and have been really enjoying it. i want to get back to running, but itâ€™s been <em>so</em> hot despite being â€œfallâ€.</p>

<p>i went to therapy this morning. i think iâ€™m going to start <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_movement_desensitization_and_reprocessing">emdr</a>. my therapist explained itâ€™s designed to mimic REM sleep (i.e., the involuntary eye movement that happens while your brain is processing the day, dreaming, etc) and make certain memories and feelings surrounding those memories less charged. iâ€™m going to pick up <em>feeling good</em> this week as well. iâ€™ve been feeling pretty good lately, which means itâ€™s the perfect time to strengthen my coping skills and overall habits.</p>
