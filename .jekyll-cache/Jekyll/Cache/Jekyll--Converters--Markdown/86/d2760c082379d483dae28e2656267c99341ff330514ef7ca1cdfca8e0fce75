  <li>today i fixed a css style loading issue. it was honestly an unfocused mess between having to figure out how to build our app with production settings, why it wasnâ€™t connecting to mongo locally (hint: SSL flags that i had to hunt down in my teamâ€™s slack history), high key panicking about <em>actually</em> having to dive into webpack and applicable doing research, an all hands meeting in the middle of the day, and lots of <em>build, refresh, cry</em> on repeat. my teammateâ€™s inital guess that we were having a css specificity issue was correct, though, so go him.</li>

  <li>elias and i went to port fonda for dinner. i got the sopa azteca and elias got mole. it was <em>so good</em>. we ate too much for people who planned on running in 90F heat later in the evening though.</li>
  <li>after dinner, i took pius for a short walk. my intention was to walk him to the plaza and back but the .5mi we already walked was clearly already too much for him.</li>

  <li>i did my short run last night as promised, but i cut it super short because the heat index was 100F at 9p (lol).</li>
  <li>elias and i ran about 4mi at a 11:25/mi pace. in normal conditions, this would have been a super easy run, but the sopa and heat started to get to me after ~3 miles. ðŸ¤¢</li>
