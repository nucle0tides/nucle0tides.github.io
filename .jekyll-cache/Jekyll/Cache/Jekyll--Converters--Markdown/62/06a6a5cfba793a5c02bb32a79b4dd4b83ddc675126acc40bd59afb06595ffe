<p>i am <em>STILL</em> struggling with rationalizing what‚Äôs going on with the bug we‚Äôre having. other than that, i had a lot of meetings, one of which was a ‚Äútech radar‚Äù meeting, which consisted of ranking technology we use, have used, and may want to use in an effort to guide future development endeavors. this meeting focused on technology we currently use, but i think we‚Äôre going to have another meeting that‚Äôs focused around newer technology and technology we don‚Äôt use.</p>

<p>i was feeling super drained after working until 6:30ish, so i decided to scooter a few blocks to get sushi and a smoothie. i had a really great walk home through the adjacent neighborhood. hardly anyone was out, but the neighborhood still alive with all the crickets chirping and the leaves rustling. i don‚Äôt know how to fully express just how <em>nice</em> it was. :)</p>
