<p>i started yesterday by walking with pius and elias to get bagels from a local bagel shop. from there we went to a nearby vegan (!!!) coffeeshop and drank iced coffee and enjoyed our bagels. fun fact, pius insists on sitting in a chair when we’re eating outside. he’s not spoiled stop saying that! i then doodled until it was time for my friends to come over. we spent the afternoon going around westport to local thrift stores. i found some GREAT stuff including a pair of (men’s) olive joggers, some amazing sweaters, and a pair of like-new madewell jeans. i ended my day learning about AI from a pretty bad textbook.</p>
