<p>yesterday we had big room planning. we’re expected to hit two big deadlines by nov 5th. i’m certainly overwhelmed by the idea, but most of the work is pretty small styling and functionality changes.</p>

<p>i met up with some friends for lunch in crossroads right after the engineering team was dismissed from big room planning. which leads me to this evening, where i spent most of the night feeling nauseous from something i ate presumably, which sucks because i had plans to lift this evening. maybe tomorrow.</p>
