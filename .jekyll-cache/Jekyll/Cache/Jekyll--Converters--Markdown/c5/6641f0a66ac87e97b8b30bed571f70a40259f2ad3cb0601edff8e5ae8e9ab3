<p>i totally didn’t mean to go a month without posting. it just…happened. in that time:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the <a href="https://www.storage-mart.com/">StorageMart</a> site was launched!!!!!!!!!!</li>
  <li>i turned 25 (ahhhHHHHHHHHHhhhhhhhhh)</li>
  <li>i ran a 5k with a friend</li>
  <li>it snowed</li>
  <li>lots of running with pius</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>since the launch of the SM website, a ton of other projects that got pushed back have been ramping up again.
    <ul>
      <li>it looks like i’m the dev lead for one of these upcoming features, which totally isn’t terrifying at all.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>today was spent fixing up my code to complete one part of our ‘facility branding’ feature, which will let facility owners set a custom logo and set of custom colors that will then take precedence over the website’s site-wide logo and colors. i’m building out the last bit of UI, DB, and API changes needed to set, save, and remove the facilty logo. it’s been a lot of fun because i’ve been able to really dig into new graphql concepts i’ve wanted to play with and see if they made sense for this ticket (they didn’t, but i know how to do them now). if all goes well, i’ll get it released next week.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>i went on a quick 2 mile run with pius right as it started sprinkling in kansas city. pius clearly had some extra pent up energy because it was kinda difficult to keep him focused.</li>
</ul>
