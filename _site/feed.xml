        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;twenty-nineteen&quot;&gt;twenty-nineteen&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;yes, i don’t actually use this blog. yes, i totally stopped my daily logs for
two months. YES, i am totally inconsistent with my self-care ventures. shut up i
know. i knowwwwwww.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;painful self-awareness aside, the last year was a huge and painful year of
growth. in the last year i:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;finally found a sense of confidence at work (it’ll be two years in a full-time
software role as of tomorrow!!!!)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;launched a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.storage-mart.com/&quot;&gt;whole website/website builder&lt;/a&gt; with my team&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;spoiled my dog endlessly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;really learned to love running (even in the dark, rain, snow, heat, cold)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ran a 5k with a friend&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;bought a used road bike on a whim and rediscovered a love of biking&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;went on my first camping trip and discovered a love of hiking and camping&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;bought waaaaaaaaaay too many shoes and clothes in an attempt to hone in on my own style
outside of my uniform of leggings, tennis shoes, and a t-shirt. you know, like
leggings, tennis shoes, a t-shirt, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a jean jacket (don’t worry,
that aesthetic will continue to prevail in 2020 anyway)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;finally resolved to seek out a therapist and found a really great one in
midtown&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;started taking a lot of vitamins, but more importantly, a lot of vitamins
&lt;em&gt;consistently&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;bought a good cookbook and learned i am actually a pretty decent cook [most of
the time]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hello-twenty-twenty&quot;&gt;hello, twenty-twenty!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i recall spending one new years when i was a teenager methodically attempting to
categorize new years resolutions based on the type of person i wanted to be. it
was a huge ennui and anxiety-fueled endeavor i obviously failed. even now, i
still add yoga classes at my gym to my calendar that i never manage to drive
over for, set google calendar goals to run ~5p every day, do laundry a few times
a week, and journal every day, only sometimes succeed in meeting
these arbitrary goals, and then berating myself for not meeting these arbitrary
goals i just throw onto myself with little support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;with that said, my intention for 2020 is to allow myself to fail without
punishment and encourage myself to be more curious and see where it takes me.
admittedly, this is a pretty vacuous statement, but ultimately want to avoid
saying “i should” and “i need to” adjacent language with respect to goal and
intention setting. i’ve made a huge amount of progress w/r/t self-compassion and
don’t want to self-sabotage that now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i am hoping to move by the end of the month for a literal fresh start. i am also
going to a vision board workshop my therapist is holding at the end of the
month for a metaphorical fresh start. finally, i am toying around with the idea of a half-marathon in april. i
just bought a new pair of weather-resistant shoes as extra monetary motivation
to train over the winter. i’m super curious as to how far i can run
(without or with little stopping) and push myself….and definitely want an
excuse to put one of those 13.1 stickers to put on my car.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>First Post, For Real This Time</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;hello-world&quot;&gt;hello, world!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i’m not one to keep a public log. i prefer more ephemeral logs: self-destructing tweets, journals haphazardly thrown into fires, post it notes left behind at at random cafes. i’m kind of in a weird, melancholic place right now. despite consistent exercise, sleep, eating, and socializing, i haven’t been feeling particularly great lately (to put it lightly) – especially my work and overall career trajectory. there was a point in time where i genuinely enjoyed creating toy projects and honing in my computer science skills in my spare time and i’ve lost touch with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;while i combat what feels like a burnout of sorts, i’ve decided to copy &lt;a href=&quot;https://ageof.info/logs/&quot;&gt;elias&lt;/a&gt; and keep a little &lt;a href=&quot;/changelog&quot;&gt;changelog&lt;/a&gt;. my intention is to use the changelog as a tool alongside daily journaling and other means of tracking to show myself things genuinely are better than i perceive them to be in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
