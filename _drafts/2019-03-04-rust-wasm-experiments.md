While on my journey to learn Rust, I've created a couple Rust and wasm projects!

The first is [Wasmdoro](https://github.com/nucle0tides/wasmdoro), a pomodoro application.
The Rust-side of this application defines a `WasmdoroTimer` struct that contains all of the timer logic.
This timer is exported as a wasm module. JavaScript is used to create a new WasmdoroTimer() from that and module defines all of the user interaction around that timer.
The UI was put together using Materialize.

Wasmdoro Timer:

The second is ðŸ…±alls (yes, the emoji is important), a canvas animation.
