### work

- broke down the aforementioned eldritch horror from yesterday into three parts:
    - a migration to cosmetically fix an issue.
    - a code change to prevent further issues (for now).
    - a meeting with the team at a later date to figure out the proper architecture for this feature.

### non-work


### exercise

- i biked to and from work today. ideally, this would have been to and from and to and from work, but it was nearly 90F when i left to go take pius to daycamp.
- i'll ideally go on a quick and easy 5k later this evening.
