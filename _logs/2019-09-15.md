# stream of conscious

i really ought to make a habit of keeping up with these logs from friday-sunday. i very rarely pick up a laptop over the weekend, though. despite only being sick tuesday, i didn't feel fully cognizant until friday. saturday was full of cleaning i had put off, lifting, and good honey shrimp from the closest chinese restaurant. sunday started later than i wanted, but i managed to do a 14 mile bike ride from westport to the river and back to westport. i regret not bringing a water bladder because my neon yellow water bottle was already empty by the time i hit 9 miles. i didn't even plan on going that far, i was just having a good time. i ended my sunday playing duck game with elias on my switch. while he may disagree, i'm way better at the game than he is. tomorrow is elias' birthday and i am completely unprepared present-wise. we're still going to celebrate by going to a restaurant he likes, i think.
