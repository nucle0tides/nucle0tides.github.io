### work

- code-wise, work was super unproductive. we're trying to improve the test coverage of our product and part of that is testing some of the legacy code that won't be updated for a while. however, a lot of our legacy components are so coupled with our redux store, it's surprisingly difficult to write meaningful tests. similarly, we're looking to add integration tests, but again, our legacy code isn't set up to support a robust testing suite. idkkkkkkkkk. it wasn't a confidence-boost. i should have fewer interruptions tomorrow so i'll be able to ideally
- process-wise, my team had a good meeting outlining our 'Definition of Ready' for tickets. it'll ease the churn between support <-> product <-> dev and design <-> product <-> dev.

### non-work

### exercise

- did 3x.5mi intervals with a pace goal of 8:30-9:30min/mi around the plaza with elias.
