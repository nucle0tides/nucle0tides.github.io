# work

i am _STILL_ struggling with rationalizing what's going on with the bug we're having. other than that, i had a lot of meetings, one of which was a "tech radar" meeting, which consisted of ranking technology we use, have used, and may want to use in an effort to guide future development endeavors. this meeting focused on technology we currently use, but i think we're going to have another meeting that's focused around newer technology and technology we don't use.

# non-work

i was feeling super drained after working until 6:30ish, so i decided to scooter a few blocks to get sushi and a smoothie. i had a really great walk home through the adjacent neighborhood. hardly anyone was out, but the neighborhood still alive with all the crickets chirping and the leaves rustling. i don't know how to fully express just how _nice_ it was. :)
