### work

- knocked out a couple of small tasks today -- one small redux addition and one addition to a specific client's `<head>` to help them with google search console debugging.
- my team is _super_ close to finishing everything for a september deadline, which is exciting!

### non-work

- i played a lot of paper mario: thousand year door this afternoon. mario is currently in the shadow realm becuase a ghost stole his identity.

### exercise

- i did a successful 5k that went through valentine, volker, west plaza, and the plaza proper.
- tomorrow i'm either going to do really quick and short intervals or run a 10k. really depends on my mood and weather.
- wednesday morning i think i'll be going to lift with elias. he's apparently quite sore already so uhhhhh aaaaaahahhahahahahahahahaha `im going to be so sore` ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³

### eratta

- it looks like elias is going to get a [papers we love chapter](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love) in kansas city started this semester. he's got quite few of our friends and peers on board already.
