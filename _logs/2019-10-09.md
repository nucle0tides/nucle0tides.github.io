# work

this past week has been a blur and it's only wednesday. i continued reviewing
PRs, testing PRs, and working on my own PRs. I left the day being super annoyed
and confused at our schema setup and mongo.

# non-work

last week, my phone's usb c port stopped working, so i wasn't able to charge it with a
cord anymore (it works with wireless charging though). after going through all
of my options, i opted to purchase a pixel 3 and it came in today! i was a big
fan of the nexus phones, so turning on my new pixel felt like catching up with
an old friend (lmao that's way cheesier and sadder now that i've typed it
out...whatever). after getting my phone set up, elias and i went to a new
restaurant down the street: mickey's hideout. it's where mccoy's used to be. i
got their chicken sandwich. it's solid.

# exercise

i got a quick 25 minute treadmill run in. my watch pace doesn't match the pace
on the treadmill, which is super annoying, but i'm happy to get the run in regardless.
