# work

today wasn't great. i spent a pretty significant amount of time crying in the
bathroom because i was stressed and feeling super incapable. things turned
around towards the end of the day and i was able to get a PR up with a
less-than-optimal solution for the problem i was solving, but i'm happy to get
it up. after getting that PR up, i spent the last 2.5 hours of the work day at
crows. before running, i got started on a tricky data migration.

# non-work
- bought pius more food.
- ate pizza at pizza 51 with elias.
- picked up the apartment.

# exercise

i took pius on a quick 2 mile run outside. i vastly underestimated just how cold
46F is and chose to wear shorts and a tank top under my rain jacket. yeah, i
warmed up, but at what cost. running with pius in cooler weather is a mix of
being pulled at a steady pace, getting *yanked* as pius zooms through puddles
and mud, and perfectly normal running. pius has a great time, and that's all
that really matters. :)
