i didn't mean to go so long without pushing a log. i haven't been having a particularly bad week, i've just forgotten!!

work-wise, we have about a month to finish the remaining QA items before ${BIG_CLIENT} launches their site. it honestly has me super stressed out. some of the bugs they're finding are quite weird.

exerise-wise, i haven't been doing any super tough workouts. pius has gone on a few runs with me, i've learned to enjoy lifing on my own, and have reacquainted myself with the ~dread~treadmill. tonight i'll probably do a quick treadmill hill run. one thing i'd like to incorporate is rock climbing again, as well as more ab workouts.

non-work-wise, i picked up rust book again and am giving it a real run-through. i'm looking forward to the project at the end and figuring out new projects to pursue.
