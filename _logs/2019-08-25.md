This log will encompass Aug 23-25.

### work

I didn't get a chance to code all that much Friday. My morning was spent helping my product owner debug/give a technical perspective on an issue that was brought up in our support channel. Beyond that, I worked on a small amount of technical debt and went to a brainstorming meeting for a new feature we need to add soon.

### non-work

I had friends in town this weekend! We spent our time eating good food, walking around midtown and enjoying the good weather, and catching up after a long summer.

### exercise

Saturday evening I went on a very quick 1.5mi run around the neighborhood. Just enough say I did something. Tomorrow I hope to avoid any thunderstorms and get a longer run in.

### eratta

I haven't read _Feeling Good_ for a few days, but I did get to the part where Burns discussed documenting cognitive distortions, categorizing them, and reframing them. I know there's a number of apps that approach this idea, but the latest (and nicest...?) one I know of is [Quirk](https://github.com/Flaque/quirk). It's under the GPL license so I'm thiking about building and loading it onto my phone...just...because... I really don't have a good reason, it just sounded like a good idea at the time lol.
