# work
today i did a lot more research on the issues we're having with [loadable-components](https://github.com/smooth-code/loadable-components). i think it's centered around how we're reading the stats file. regardless, i may be able to at least set up the recommended `ErrorBoundary` called out in their documentation. i'm not sure how i'll actually fix the issue. we'll see!

# non work
i'm going to the first [papers we love](https://paperswelove.org/) meeting tonight!

# exercise
after papers we love, i'm hoping to get over to the gym to lift. i've gone with elias twice now and have been really enjoying it. i want to get back to running, but it's been *so* hot despite being "fall".

# errata
i went to therapy this morning. i think i'm going to start [emdr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_movement_desensitization_and_reprocessing). my therapist explained it's designed to mimic REM sleep (i.e., the involuntary eye movement that happens while your brain is processing the day, dreaming, etc) and make certain memories and feelings surrounding those memories less charged. i'm going to pick up _feeling good_ this week as well. i've been feeling pretty good lately, which means it's the perfect time to strengthen my coping skills and overall habits.
