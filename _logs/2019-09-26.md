# work

don't talk to me about that bug l o l

# non-work

i made a pretty subpar ground beef + pasta sauce and lentil pasta dinner tonight. i'll probably play more link's awakening (don't worry, i haven't forgotten about paper mario!) and take pius on a walk. oh, laundry too. can't forget laundry.

# exercise

i biked to and from work today. today was surprisingly difficult. my quads felt dead, my backpack was extra heavy, my chest was super tight. other than physical discomfort, it was really enjoyable. the weather has been beautiful lately and i want to absorb as much as i can before winter.
