i obviously missed several days around labor day weekend. tl;dr -- it was good and bad.

### work

- work wasn't great.
- i tried working from broadway today but left as soon as i just started crying because i was super sad lol.

### non-work

- picked up my rabbit's litter box and food area. smalls has a horrible habit of THROWING his food bowl, causing a huge mess.
- more paper mario. i'm almost done with the game.

### exercise

- i biked to the plaza to meet elias at shake shack. i tried their mushroom burger. it was alright.
- biked back from the plaza.
- small 2mi run around the neighborhood. i always feel like that spongegar meme running around at night between my existence alone at night and the sidewalk death traps.
