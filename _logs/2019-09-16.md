### work
today i got a PR in to start a new "branding" feature we're building. i then started researching an issue we're having with [loadable-components](https://github.com/smooth-code/loadable-components). i didn't much work done, mostly research, documentation reading, and issue reading on github.

### non-work
today was elias' birthday! the majority of my evening was spent at port fonda with elias, his mom, and his sister. we ended the night watching some netflix.
