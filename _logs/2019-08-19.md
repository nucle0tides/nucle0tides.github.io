### work

- i implemented a few small fixes on the product i work on that were a consequence of fast implementation and even faster QA. unfortunately, one of my fixes unveiled a much larger, systemic issue with a feature my team built a just over a year ago. i swore it worked when it was implemented. ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€

### non-work

- i read a bit of _Feeling Good_ by David D. Burns over lunch. i'm currently in the middle of learning about different cognition patterns that lead to and contribute to a depressed mood.
- elias and i ad libbed a stir fry for dinner. the vegetables ended up getting pretty soggy this attempt, but it was otherwise pretty good.

### exercise

- i had a really great bike ride to work. the weather was beautiful. however, i opted to have elias pick me up in the afternoon due to an oppressive heat index and an all-uphill ride back to my place.
- i'll probably end up doing a quick run when the sun goes down.

### errata

- my rabbit, smalls, celebrated his 9th birthday last week!
- i'm currently hunting for new leggings to replace a few pairs that have pilled and have never really liked. additionally, i'm looking for a pair of joggers for fall.
