### work

- i worked from a local coffeeshop all day.
- got quite a few PRs reviewed.
- picked up a new ticket BUT
- got thrown into a post-release issue surrounding missing data and a borken component. this will be hotfixed tomorrow.

### non-work

- i read more _Feeling Good_ over lunch today. the chapter i'm reading talks of combating do-nothingism. unsurprisingly, the fear of failure stood out to me. i might re-read this chapter and take thorough notes.
- more paper mario. i'm just over halfway through the game now.

### exercise

- just walked pius to the plaza and back.
